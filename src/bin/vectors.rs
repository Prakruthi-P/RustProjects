/*
A Vector is a resizable array. 
It stores values in contiguous memory blocks. 
The predefined structure Vec can be used to create vectors. 
Some important features of a Vector are âˆ’

A Vector can grow or shrink at runtime.
A Vector is a homogeneous collection.
A Vector stores data as sequence of elements in a particular order. Every element in a Vector is assigned a unique index number. 
The index starts from 0 and goes up to n-1 where, n is the size of the collection.
A Vector will only append values to (or near) the end. In other words, a Vector can be used to implement a stack.
Memory for a Vector is allocated in the heap.

Syntax - Creating a Vector
let mut instance_name = Vec::new();
let vector_name = vec![val1,val2,val3]

new()	
pub fn new()->Vect
Constructs a new, empty Vec. The vector will not allocate until elements are pushed onto it.

push()	
pub fn push(&mut self, value: T)
Appends an element to the back of a collection.

remove()	
pub fn remove(&mut self, index: usize) -> T
Removes and returns the element at position index within the vector, shifting all elements after it to the left.

contains()	
pub fn contains(&self, x: &T) -> bool
Returns true if the slice contains an element with the given value.

len()	
pub fn len(&self) -> usize
Returns the number of elements in the vector, also referred to as its 'length'.
